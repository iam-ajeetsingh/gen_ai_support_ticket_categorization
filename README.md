# Support Ticket Categorization using Generative AI-NLP

This repository contains the project **"Support Ticket Categorization using Generative AI-NLP"**, which leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the LLaMA (Large Language Model) to automate the classification and processing of support tickets. The project aims to streamline customer support operations by categorizing tickets, assigning priorities, suggesting resolution times, and generating sentiment-based responses.

## Project Description

The **Support Ticket Categorization** project is designed to automate the handling of customer support tickets. By utilizing a generative AI model, the system can:
- Classify support tickets into predefined categories.
- Assign priority levels based on the urgency of the issue.
- Suggest estimated resolution times (ETA).
- Generate professional and sentiment-aligned first responses to customer queries.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI in improving customer support efficiency and reducing manual workload.
